//! Conventional channels (analog NBFM, P25): energy-detected, so an idle
//! channel costs almost nothing.
//!
//! ```text
//! every block, per channel, from the channelizer's own spectrum (no head):
//!   band power (±5 kHz) vs the local noise floor → SNR (dB)
//! SNR ≥ squelch → open a head with pre-roll (the air from before detection)
//!   → channel filter / carrier meter (±5.5 kHz: confirms the carrier, so FFT
//!     leakage from a strong neighbour doesn't make a call)
//!   → NBFM demod → 8 kHz audio          (fm; unit IDs from MDC1200 /
//!                                        FleetSync bursts in it, the CTCSS
//!                                        tone / DCS code from below it)
//!   → receiver bank → voice tracker     (p25; talkgroup from link control)
//!   → 4FSK → DMR framer → both slots   (dmr; a call on each slot, talkgroup
//!                                        from link control)
//! a call starts with the first audio (or P25 link control), ends when there
//! has been none for the call timeout; the head closes once the carrier has
//! been gone for CLOSE_HANG_S with no call.
//! ```
//!
//! Several rows on one frequency are one channel, each row with its own
//! access code ([`Access`]: a CTCSS tone or DCS code, a P25 NAC, a DMR colour
//! code / slot / talkgroup), at most one with none. Each transmission goes
//! to the row whose code it carries (the most specific, for DMR), else to
//! the row with none, else isn't recorded:
//! - FM: held until its tone is known, then filed under that row's
//!   talkgroup, as P25 files a call under the talkgroup its link control
//!   names. A frequency whose only row has no tone isn't held.
//! - P25: every frame carries the NAC, so nothing is held; on a frequency
//!   with several rows, filed under the row's talkgroup (conventional radios
//!   mostly send a talkgroup that says little, often 1).
//! - DMR: per slot; filed under the talkgroup on the air, as always (the row
//!   gives the names).
//!
//! A detection the carrier meter doesn't confirm raises that channel's open
//! threshold to just above what triggered it, until the band quietens again,
//! so a neighbour's leakage doesn't reopen the head every block.
//!
//! The noise floor is per source: the median of each 1/64 of the band,
//! smoothed over time, which follows the SDR's passband shape and ignores
//! signals filling under half a slice.
