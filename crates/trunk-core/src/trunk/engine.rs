//! Trunked systems above the radio(s) — Trunk Recorder's
//! monitor_messages() loop plus its recorders, for each system:
//!
//! ```text
//! source(s) u8 IQ → Channelizer per source
//!   control channel head → receiver bank → TSDU groups → TSBKs → TsbkParser → CallManager
//!   CallManager.start_recording → a voice head on whichever source covers the
//!     frequency (with pre-roll) → receiver bank → VoiceTracker → audio
//!     (Phase 2 TDMA: H-DQPSK receiver → slot framer → TdmaTracker, one head
//!     for both slots)
//!   call end → Concluded (TR JSON + audio)
//! ```
//!
//! Several sources (dongles) feed every system: each system's control channel
//! runs on the source that covers it, each voice channel on the source that
//! covers its frequency. The systems share the sources and the recorder pool;
//! each has its own control channel, band plan, talkgroups and calls, and its
//! own time — its control channel's sample clock. Each site of a multi-site
//! system is a system of its own (see [`SystemConfig::expect`]); a call heard
//! on several sites is recorded on each and the best copy saved (see
//! [`super::multisite`]).
//!
//! Conventional channels (analog FM, P25) ride the same channelizers: see
//! [`super::conventional`]. A config may have trunked systems, conventional
//! channels, or both. Everything that happens is reported as [`Event`]s; the
//! engine does no I/O.
